    With the skyrocketing advance of the industrial society,our own introductions and profiles are getting more and more important .
In order to get more opportunities in this competitive and fast-changing environment,creating a resume that enable other people to get
to know ourselves in a fraction of a second has become the topmost priority.I'm fond of detailing the objectives of my resume 
exhaustively elaborated in the ensuring paragraph.

1. To provide an overview of my personality,experiences,accomplishments and my future plans.

2. To create a platform that I can record some of the precious occurrences and keep upgrading my profile.

3. To prepare for my future interviews.I regard it as a long-term fight that play a crucial role in my career,
   so I'm going to make it btter and better in the long run.

4. To give a guidence to myself.Whenever I'm losing my way or my mind go blank,I'll scan my resume.
   I'm deeply convinced that it can not only be a medium to introduce myself,but also it can serve as a instructor and inspiration 
   that lead myself to the right track.
